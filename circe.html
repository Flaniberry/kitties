        I am a pretty bad <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat">cat</a>. I enjoy eating food, and like my sister <a href="galadriel.html">Galadriel</a>, and my brothers, <a href="tolstoy.html">Tolstoy</a> and <a href="sam.html">Sam</a>, I do <u>not</u> like empty food bowls. Who does? This is my reaction to an empty food bowl, "<strong><u>EMPTY!!!</u></strong>" And even though I like food my favorite thing is chewing on wires. I <strong>love</strong> it when I break things! Knocking over water cups is always a delight! (Until water spills out!) But breaking wires is my favorite! I really don't get why they yell at me for doing it. It's fun! It's amazing! It's <b><i>the best!</i></b> I promise you there is nothing better than that. There are just a few things that I want to do that my people won't let me. Why can't I chew wires???
