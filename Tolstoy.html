          I am an annoyed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat">cat</a>. I like eating food, and and like like my sisters <a
            href="index.html">Galadriel</a> and <a href="circe.html">Circe</a>, I do <u>not</u> like empty food bowls. How would
          you like it if one day <em>your</em> food bowl was empty? I like chasing toys, and other cats. My favorite thing is
          chasing my toy! You just <strong>can't</strong> beat that! I never do get tired of chasing it!! There is nothing better
          than that on earth I tell you! It's <i>sooooooooooooooo</i> fun! <i>My girl</i> is often who I play with. She pets me,
          gives me treats,etc,etc... Oh and I would like to say, <i><u>'Meow!'</u></i> I like to rub against her face, and do
          stuff like try and type. This something I have typed,"y" Just the y but I did close out of some things! As you can see,
          I am a troublesome cat! If your thinking <i>my girl</i> is just amazing, there <i>are</i> some things she won't let me
          do that I don't get why! <b>Why</b> can't I eat her food or go outside?! I don't like empty food bowls, but I do like
          human food. I think I do. But maybe I don't. I don't know. I am an ornery cat.
