          I am a <em>VERY</em> fat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat">cat</a>. I am all about eating food, and
          constantly worried about starving because my servants neglect me. I do <u>not</u> need to have empty food bowls <em> ever</em>! I need food, okay! All cats do, and I have three <em>cats</em> who agree with me. My sister, <a href="circe.html">Circe</a> and my brothers, <a href="tolstoy.html">Tolstoy</a> and <a href="sam.html">Sam</a>! There have been <strong>too many</strong> times when I wake up and my food bowl is empty. <strong><u>EMPTY!!!</u></strong>
          Next time a food bowl is empty I am going to meow so loud it will be impossible to ignore me! So, if you're in
          charge of the food bowls, you better keep them full or I will literally <em>starve</em>! I don't care about you being a hairless, tall thing, as long as you keep my food bowls full, which I haven't seen progress. They <em>have</em> to be full to the top!
